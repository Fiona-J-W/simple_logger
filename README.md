simple_logger
=============

A simple, easily reviewable logging library.

This library is developed for inclusion into [CAcerts Cassiopeia](https://github.com/CAcertOrg/cacert-cassiopeia)
and therefore attempts to have very simple code implementing only things that are really needed, so
that it can easily be reviewed.

**If you want advanced features, highly optimized code or the ability to log from more than
one thread, changes are that another library would serve you better!**

However, even for cacert, the usually demanded software is “simple plus just those two features”, so
not all hope is lost. ;-)


Status
------

The library is currently in alpha-stage and may still change parts of it's interface.

For this reason there hasn't been a review yet either.

License
-------

For the meantime GPL v2 or later.
